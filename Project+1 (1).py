# Starting from the The Movie DataBase (TMDB) sample datasets
# 
# 1- For each movie, compute the number of cast members
# 2- How many movies do not have a homepage?
# 3- For each year, how many movies do not have a homepage?
# 4- Extract the domain of each homepage.
# 5- Extract a set of normalized tables. That is, each entry of a normalized table must contain exactly one value (not a list or a dictionary).
# 6- For each movie, compute the gross margin (difference between revenue and budget)
# 7- For each movie, compute the number of crew members
# 8- For each movie, compute the number of directors
# 9- For each language, compute the number of movies where such language is spoken.
# 10- For each company and each decade, compute the overall revenue
# 11- For each decade, compute the company with maximum revenue
# 12- In each year, how many movies have revenue smaller than the budget?
# 
# 1- Distribute the revenue according to the order of appearance in a movie. Assume that the i-th actor contributes twice as much as the (i+1)-th actor to the revenue.
# 2- For each actor find the total revenue attributed to him/her.
# 3- Find the actor that is responsible for the most overall revenue.
# 
# 1- For each movie, compute the ratio between males and females in the cast
# 2- For each movie, compute the ratio between the attributed revenue of males and females in the cast
# 3- Find the director that has the highest average ratio computed in the previous point.
